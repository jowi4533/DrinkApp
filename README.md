1. In the App.js we create the navigation stacks for routing within the app.
2. All the different views are found in jojax/screens folder.
3. We have some custom components (most buttons) that are located at jojax/components.
4. We have a color scheme that we import to all views located in the jojax/assets folder.
5. The custom fonts are located at jojax/fonts. We had some issues placing them in the assets folder so we had to keep them outside.
6. Some images are located in jojax/pictures folder. The rest are stored in the database.
